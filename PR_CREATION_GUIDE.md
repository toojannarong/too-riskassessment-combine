```

### 2. Commit the changes
```bash
git commit -m "docs: Add comprehensive recommendation features analysis and test coverage

- Added complete technical analysis of recommendation features
- Analyzed existing test coverage and identified critical gaps
- Highlighted missing MongoDB Atlas Search testing (CRITICAL)
- Prioritized test implementation by criticality and business impact
- Provided specific test scenarios and implementation guidelines
- Added examples for integration, security, and performance tests
- Documented complete architecture, data flow, and API specifications

This analysis will help ensure robust testing of the recommendation
system including Atlas Search, Kafka events, and frontend integration."

**Title:** `docs: Add comprehensive recommendation features analysis and test coverage`

**Description:**
```markdown
## Summary
This PR adds comprehensive documentation for the recommendation features including complete technical analysis and critical test coverage gaps assessment.

## What's Added
- **Complete Features Analysis** (`RECOMMENDATION_FEATURES_COMPLETE_ANALYSIS.md`)
  - Full technical architecture documentation
  - End-to-end implementation details
  - API specifications and data flow
  - Technology stack and integration points

- **Test Coverage Analysis** (`RECOMMENDATION_TEST_COVERAGE_ANALYSIS.md`)
  - Current test coverage assessment
  - Missing critical test scenarios
  - Implementation priority guidelines
  - Specific test examples and code snippets

## Key Findings
- ✅ Good unit test coverage for individual components
- ⚠️ **CRITICAL:** MongoDB Atlas Search has NO test coverage (only endpoint using this feature)
- ❌ Missing integration tests with real MongoDB and Kafka
- ❌ No end-to-end API testing with full HTTP stack
- ❌ Limited security and performance testing
- ❌ Frontend integration tests need enhancement

## Priority Recommendations
1. **CRITICAL:** MongoDB Atlas Search testing (unique feature, zero coverage)
2. **High Priority:** Repository integration tests, API integration tests, Kafka-to-DB flow
3. **Medium Priority:** Complex filtering scenarios, error handling, frontend E2E
4. **Low Priority:** Contract tests, monitoring tests

## Benefits
- Identifies critical gaps in current test coverage
- Provides implementation roadmap for test improvements
- Ensures comprehensive verification of recommendation features
- Improves system reliability and maintainability

## Type of Change
- [x] Documentation
- [ ] Bug fix
- [ ] New feature
- [ ] Breaking change

## Next Steps
The team can use this analysis to:
1. Plan test implementation in upcoming sprints
2. Prioritize critical missing tests
3. Ensure comprehensive coverage before production releases
```

**Reviewers:** Add relevant team members who work on testing, backend, or frontend development.

**Labels:** 
- `documentation`
- `testing`
- `enhancement`
- `recommendation-feature`

## File Locations

```

## Additional Notes
- This is a documentation-only PR with no code changes
- The analysis is based on current codebase as of the analysis date
- Recommendations should be discussed with the team before implementation
- Consider creating follow-up tickets/stories for implementing the identified tests
