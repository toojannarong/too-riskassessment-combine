**Title:** `docs: Add comprehensive test coverage analysis for recommendation features`

**Description:**
```markdown
## Summary
This PR adds a comprehensive analysis of the current test coverage for recommendation features and identifies critical missing tests to ensure end-to-end verification.

## What's Added
- **Test Coverage Analysis Document** (`RECOMMENDATION_TEST_COVERAGE_ANALYSIS.md`)
  - Current test coverage assessment
  - Missing critical test scenarios
  - Implementation priority guidelines
  - Specific test examples and code snippets

## Key Findings
- ✅ Good unit test coverage for individual components
- ❌ Missing integration tests with real MongoDB and Kafka
- ❌ No end-to-end API testing with full HTTP stack
- ❌ Limited security and performance testing
- ❌ Frontend integration tests need enhancement

## Priority Recommendations
1. **High Priority:** Repository integration tests, API integration tests, Kafka-to-DB flow
2. **Medium Priority:** Complex filtering scenarios, error handling, frontend E2E
3. **Low Priority:** Contract tests, monitoring tests

## Benefits
- Identifies critical gaps in current test coverage
- Provides implementation roadmap for test improvements
- Ensures comprehensive verification of recommendation features
- Improves system reliability and maintainability

## Type of Change
- [x] Documentation
- [ ] Bug fix
- [ ] New feature
- [ ] Breaking change

## Next Steps
The team can use this analysis to:
1. Plan test implementation in upcoming sprints
2. Prioritize critical missing tests
3. Ensure comprehensive coverage before production releases
```

**Reviewers:** Add relevant team members who work on testing, backend, or frontend development.

**Labels:** 
- `documentation`
- `testing`
